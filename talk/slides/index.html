        <h2>
          What is git-deploy?
        </h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A deployment tool conceived and introduced at Booking.com in 2008
          </li>
          <li>
            We've made it open source, clone it on GitHub.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should use it, and here's why...
          </li>

      <article>
        <h3>
          It's a tool to make deployments really easy
        </h3>
        <p>
          We've gone from deployments being a hard manual process, to
          doing dozens of them a day.
        </p>

        <h3>
          It's highly configurable and pluggable
        </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            We use it to deploy around 20 environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Those 20 environments have around 60 hooks between them to
            customize deployments.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          What's the core concept behind it?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            git-deploy will create an annotated git tag for all your
            rollouts.
          </li>
          <li>
            This gives you permanent git-level history of all your
            rollouts..
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>So how does it actually work</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Rollouts are done from a designated git repository cloned
            from your main repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only one user can do a rollout at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you've locked the deployment server you can perform
            any git operation you want (<code>git
            pull/commit/cherry-pick/reset</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            When you're ready you <i>sync</i>. This creates <b>a
            tag</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            This calls <b>your</b> sync hook.
          </li>
          <li>
            When that's done you <i>finish</i> which unlocks
            deployments, pushes the tags, sends E-Mail etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h3>Step 1: <i>start</i></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Creates a <code>.git/deploy/lock</code> file in your
            deployment repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Does a <code>git pull</code> for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Runs any <i>start</i> hooks.
            <pre>
# checks that we're on "master"
cron/pre-start.001_nobranch_rollout.pl
</pre>
          <li>
            You can also do hotfix, it's just a <i>start</i> without
            the <code>git pull</code> and the start hooks.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can always <i>abort</i> the deploy at this point
            before you <i>sync</i>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h3>Step 1: <i>start</i> - example of someone already deploying</h3>
        <q>I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that</q>
        <ul>
          <li>
<pre>
$ git-deploy start
# INFO : Starting step 'start' at 2012-02-02 16-22-01
# FATAL: You may not start a new rollout as it looks like one is already in progress!
# FATAL: Failed to create lock dir '.git/deploy' because 'File exists'

        <h3>Step 1: <i>start</i> - example of a successful <i>start</i></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Output truncated, runs staging webserver restart hooks and
            has more useful output:
            <pre>
$ git-deploy start
# INFO : Starting step 'start' at 2012-02-02 16-30-12
# INFO : Working directory was checked out to tag 'app-20120202-160118', will restore this tag on abort
# INFO : Step 'start' concluded at 2012-02-02 16:30:12 took 29 seconds to complete
# YAY  : 'start' for 'app' completed successfully
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Now ready for the <i>sync</i> step:
            <pre>
$ git-deploy status
# NOTE : app rollout started - not synced yet (app-20120202-160118)
# NOTE : start: 2012-02-02 16:30:12     trunk   639022c78daf1b85b76d4816803a6d37bef67e10        3374    aearnfjord

      <article>
        <h3>Step 2: <i>sync</i></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            This is when you've decided that what you have staged is
            good enough.
          </li>
          <li>
            It creates a tag to permanently tag this commit as having
            been rolled out in this environment at this time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calls a <i>sync hook</i> that you define.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your sync hook has an error at this point it's up to you to resolve it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Step 3: <i>finish</i></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Run for you when <i>sync</i> finishes successfully, or
            manually if your <i>sync hook</i> had an error.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pushes your shiny new tag to your main repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sends out an E-Mail announcing your new rollout if you've
            configured it to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlocks the staging server so you can do another rollout.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Why use it?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It makes reverts really easy. Helpful when you've just
            broken something.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can see your your entire deployment history at the git level.
          </li>

          <li>
            It does really exhaustive error checking -- added over
            years of trial and error as its inexperienced users have
            tried to screw up rollouts in every way possible.
          <li>

          <li>
            It ensures that the appropriate tags are created, and that
            they're pushed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>
          What doesn't it do?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Worry about how your code is synced out, that's your job.
          </li>

          <li>
            <code>git push</code>
          </li>

          <li>
             rsync it.
          </li>

          <li>
            make a <code>Debian</code> or <code>RPM</code> package out
            of it.
          </li>

          <li>
            tar it up, gpg sign it and mail it around.
          </li>

          <li>
            strap it to a pigeon.
          </li>

          <li>
            This means you can most likely use it with your existing
            deployment infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>

            Who cares if it passes the tests? Do customers like it?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which means less emphasis on unit testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Which means more frequent deploys to see if you're still OK.
          </li>
          <li>
            ...and rapid rollbacks if you're not.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enough monitoring can replace testing, but testing can never replace monitoring.
