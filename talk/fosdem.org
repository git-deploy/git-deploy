* What is it, a tool to make deployments really easy

  We've gone from deployments being hard one-off bullshit to doing 20
  of them a day at least.

* It's really adaptable

  It's highly configurable and pluggable, we use it for deploying
  everything from single-server environments to deploying our main web
  server cluster.

* What's the core concept behind it?

  You have a tag in your repository corresponding to every rollout,
  that's right, every single rollout.

* What sort of tool is it?

  It's a Unix tool, it does one thing and does it well, it's hookable,
  the hooks are standard *nix programs, it runs anywhere Perl 5.8
  runs.

* How does it actually operate?

** There's a locking phase

*** Only one person can do rollouts at a time
*** Rollouts are done from one repository
*** This is your staging server
*** Locks are just a .git/deploy/lock file

** You can do anything you want after you're locked

*** git-pull, we do this on start
*** make new commits
*** pull new commits
*** You just have to push them before..
*** You can "abort" at this point

** You sync
*** This is when you declare that the current state is the one you're syncing out
*** It calls a sync hook, which YOU DEFINE

** You finish the rollout
*** Once the sync is done you "finish"
*** On "sync" this is done for you on a successful "sync"
*** If "sync" fails you manually fix it up, and do "finish" yourself

* Why do you want to use this?

** It's a revert tool as well as a rollback tool
** You can see your entire deployment history at the git-level

   <example of git-deploy show here>
** It does really exhaustive error checking

   added over years of trial and error as its inexperienced users have
   tried to screw up rollouts in every way possible.
** It ensures that the appropriate tags are created, and that they're pushed

* What doesn't it do?

** Worry about how your code is synced out, that's your job
** This means you can use it with existing deployment solutions
** Including ones you think might be incompatible

* How do you sync out your code?

** git push
** rsync
** Debian, RPM package etc. from the currnent code
** GPG signed tarballs sent via SMTP
** GPG signed tarballs sent via carrier pigeons

* Examples!

** git-deploy status
** git-deploy show
** git-deploy start
** git-deploy abort
** git-deploy sync
** an error!
** git-deploy finish

* Puppet-friendly Git-powered configuration`tm
