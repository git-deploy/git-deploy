Revision history for git-deploy

{{$NEXT}}

6.01      2012-12-19 16:57:00 UTC

    - Add a post-start hook phase where we can print out custom
      messages or end the start phase (e.g. if rollouts are blocked).

    - Pass GIT_DEPLOY_ACTION to hooks so hooks can see what action
      started something.

    - Removed Booking.com specific Git::Deploy::Hook::* code.

    - Add where to get the source to the POD and be explicit about
      what license git-deploy is under.

    - Fixed an issue where we'd die when trying to print out an error
      on invalid refs.

    - Add facility to emit custom error messages on sync hook failure
      by setting deploy.message-on-sync-hook-fail-whale in the config.

    - Skip tests (instead of failing) on platforms that don't have Git
      installed.
